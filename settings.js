/**
 * Settings, their defaults, and loading/saving them.

 * Most live in chrome.storage.sync, one item per setting, so they follow the user to their
 * other computers through their own Chrome Sync, like Chrome's own settings. They are plain
 * preferences (menu style, direction, keys, sites to leave alone), not personal data, and
 * Chrome Sync keeps them in the user's own Google account: the developer receives nothing, so
 * "no data collected" stays true. (Signed out of Chrome, sync storage simply stays on the computer.)
 *
 * chrome.storage.local holds what is tied to one computer: single-key mode, where it runs and
 * the chosen sites, which only work with site access, and Chrome grants that per computer, from
 * a click on that computer. It also holds any write sync refused (see writeSynced), kept and retried.
