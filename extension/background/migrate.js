/**
 * Moves settings into Chrome Sync for installs made before syncing was always on. The
 * background runs it on install, update and startup, before reading settings; it is safe to run
 * any number of times (once moved, there is nothing left to move).
 *
 * Earlier builds kept every setting in chrome.storage.local, with an opt-in switch
 * (`syncSettings`, local) that mirrored most of them into one sync item (`settings`).
 *
 * Sync wins: a setting already in sync (from another computer) stays; the old mirrored item
 * comes next; this computer's local copy fills whatever is left. Old copies are removed only
 * after their values are safely written (or held for sync by writeSynced), so nothing is lost.
